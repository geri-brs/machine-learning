# About my ML repository
* Python codes what I wrote since I started learning python, these exercises made for practicing and learning the language. Furthermore the repository contains some simple machine learning exercises what I learned by tutorials.
# Motivation
* My goal is to learn as much as possible about machine learning, that's an extremely interesting area of artifical intelligence.
# Framework used
* Jupyter notebook
* Visual Studio Code
## 1. [Python](https://github.com/methos90/machine-learning/tree/master/1-python-learning)
* This folder contains python exercises for learning basics of the language.
## 2. [Machine learning](https://github.com/methos90/machine-learning/tree/master/2-machine-learning)
* This folder contains sample exercises what I learned through courses and articles.
## 3. [Cheatsheets](https://github.com/methos90/machine-learning/tree/master/3-cheatsheets)
* This folder contains useful cheatsheet to study basic functions.
